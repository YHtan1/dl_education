- This repo will store some Jupyter notebooks I made while learning deep learning on my own. 

- Sorry if the code written is not up to par - will try to improve during my self-learning journey!

- I'll try to regularly update this repo with new stuff I learnt - hopefully able to learn html+javascript and build and host my own website!

- If time permits, I'll probably even livestream myself build interesting stuff
